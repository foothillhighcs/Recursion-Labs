# Recursion-Labs
Here is the starter code for your different options for the Recursion Lab

You will choose to do ONE of the following labs: EraseObject, KnightsTour, or Maze. 

EraseObject and Maze require scanning in flies (test cases are included). KnightsTour is self contained.

The only code that will require input is EraseObject where you will type in a row and column number (think BattleShip). The others should complete on their own.

Display is included but could/should be updated based on the project you are choosing to do.
